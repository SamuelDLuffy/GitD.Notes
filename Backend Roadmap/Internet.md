How does the internet works

	The internet is a global network of computers or other devices connected to each other, using standardized protocols, primarily TCP/IP. When you request a webpage, your device sends a data packet through your internet service provider to a DNS server, which translates the website's domain name into an IP address. The packet is then routed across various networks(using routers and switches) to the destination server, which processes the request and sends back the response. This black-and-forth exchange enables the transfer of data like web pages, files and etc, making the internet a dynamic, decentralized system for global communication.

The internet was developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense.
