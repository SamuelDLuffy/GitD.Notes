HTTP

Hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext requests via the World Wide Web. The messages sent by the client are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses. The protocol defines how messages(request) are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. HTTP operates on a *request-response* model: a client(web browser for ex) sends a HTTP request to a server for resources, such as web pages or files, and the server responds with the requested content and an *HTTP status code indicating the result of the request*. 

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent and does not retain information about previous interactions. 

It forms the foundation of data communication on the web and is typically used with secure HTTP (HTTPS) for encrypted communication.

A Web page is a hypertext document. The browser (always the client-side) do a request for a server-side. The browser recieve the response, parses the file, and further interprets to present the user the web page. This file contain the html that indicate the origin of the web page, thee customization (CSS) and the scripts. Usually the scrips when executade does another requests for server-side, this way the client-side can do another fecths and navigate, update and receive data on the World Wide Web.
